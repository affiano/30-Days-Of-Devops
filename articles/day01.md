# Deploying an Ruby App from Gitlab to Heroku
Deploy an ruby application hosted in Gitlab to Heroku, using Gitlab CI/CD.

## Solution
### Configurating Heroku account
[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is a PaaS with support to several programmming languages.

In first place, you need to create the heroku application, at **New> Create new app:**

![example](https://edsoncelio.github.io/static/new_project_heroku.png)

Setting up the app name (in my case, itâ€™s *demo-app-gitlab*), and create:

![example](https://edsoncelio.github.io/static/create_app_heroku.png)

Since we will use a ruby project, you need to configure the [buildpack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) to the language, accessing **Settings>Add buildpacks:**

![example](https://edsoncelio.github.io/static/heroku_buildpack.png)

Itâ€™s done, now is time to setting up your token to acess this app with the Gitlab.

Go to **Account>API Key**, and generate a new API key, and save that.

### Configurating Gitlab account
Gitlab CI is a tool inside Gitlab to provide continuous integration, continuous delivery and continous deployment. Itâ€™s works using a file called `.gitlab-ci.yml` placed at the repositoryâ€™s root.

To this project, we will deploy an ruby application (you can use the [sample application](https://github.com/heroku/ruby-getting-started)).

First, create your secret variable with the heroku API Key accessing **gitlab.com///-/settings/ci_cd > Variables:**

![example](https://edsoncelio.github.io/static/variable_gitlab.png)

**Observation**: the name of your variable is `HEROKU_STAGING_API`

Create an repository with your project, and place the file `.gitlab-ci.yml` with the content inside:

```
develop:
  stage: deploy
  script:
  - gem install dpl
  - dpl --provider=heroku --app=demo-app-gitlab --api-key=$HEROKU_STAGING_API_KEY
  only:
  - develop
```

Some important notes:

- `--app=demo-app-gitlab`: this is the name of your app created at heroku
- `--api-key=$HEROKU_STAGING_API_KEY`: this is the variable used to connect with our heroku app
- only: `- develop` : this is about deploy your app just when has a pull in develop branch
